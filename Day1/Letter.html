       I, Neel Patel, would like to request for your permission for allowing me<br>
       to attend the <b>30 days of code</b> which is a code camp organized by Devsnest.<br>
       Where they will be introducing us to:<br>
       <ul>
           <li>DSA</li>
    
        <li>front-end Development</li>
        </ul><br>
        I would really like to attend this workshop and will have to skip some lectures,<br>

        attend the workshop, I would really appreciate it. <br><br><br>
